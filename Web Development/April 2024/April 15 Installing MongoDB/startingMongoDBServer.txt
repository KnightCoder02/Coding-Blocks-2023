1. - Create a data folder where we want to store the data

2. - Run the following commands
        > mongod --dbpath=data
        No spaces before and after '=' in --dbpath=data
        It will start the mongodb server inside the data folder, now it will store the data inside the data folder

3. To check the server is running or not
        - In browser open: localhost:27017

Message comes: It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.
That means mongodb server is running perfectly fine.

Then in new terminal, without closing the previous one
    - Run the following command
    > mongosh
