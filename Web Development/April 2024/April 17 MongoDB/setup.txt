- Start the mongoDB server
    - Create data folder
    > mongod --dbpath=data

- To connect with mongoDB server we write
    > mongosh
    This will connect you with mongoDB server, where we can type the queries for mongoDB. 

INSIDE MONGOSE TERMINAL
    - show dbs: //To check the available databases

To create to new DB
    - use db_name; //If db_name exist then it will switch otherwise it will create a new db

To create a collection, inside a Database (It's similar to what we have inside SQL: TABLE)
    - db.createCollection("collection_name");
    Example:
    - db.createCollection('students'); // This will create the collection of students

- Inside the collection we insert data, that we call "document"
    - This is what we call as running queries on our collections.

    - Server
        - databases
            - collections
                - documents
